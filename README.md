*POincare MAp TOpology extraction*

**Automatic extraction and visualization of the topology of 2D Poincaré maps in the circular restricted three-body problem.**

This library offers a suite of tools to extract the fixed points and invariant manifolds of the Poincaré map in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). 

This library contains code written by Wayne Schlei as part of his PhD thesis titled "INTERACTIVE SPACECRAFT TRAJECTORY DESIGN STRATEGIES FEATURING POINCARE MAP TOPOLOGY" in the department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Purdue University that he completed in 2017. The library features a tool that visualizes the topological structures and permits their interactive analysis. Also included is a python executable called pomato.py that facilitates the proper use of the various computational pieces involved in the topology extraction. 

This project requires following third-party open source libraries:

* Boost: https://www.boost.org/
* Teem:  http://teem.sourceforge.net/
* Eigen: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/
* VTK:   https://www.vtk.org/
